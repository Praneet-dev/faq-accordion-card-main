## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I learnt to animate the appearance and disappearance of a block using javascript, which in this case were the answers to different questions.

- Also learnt to center an absolutely positioned image (or any other block) whose dimension is not fixed using javascript.

### Continued development

I could make the javascript part more efficient by not having to loop over all the question whenever a user views the answer to a single question by clicking on it. I probably need to learn event delegation and data attribute to make the code more efficient.


### Useful resources

- [How can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS?
](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3149710/16570555) - This helped me animate the appearance and disappearance of answers to questions.
- [Understanding vertical-align, or "How (Not) To Vertically Center Content"](http://phrogz.net/css/vertical-align/index.html) - This article helped me figure out the way to align items in the center vertically.
